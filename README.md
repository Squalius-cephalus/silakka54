# Silakka54

Silakka54 is a RP2040 based 54-key column staggered split keyboard. PCB uses hotswap sockets. Design is inpired from REVIUNG41 and Corne keyboards.

PCB is designed for MX style key switches. Current top plate only supports MX style switches. 5-pin switches is supported.

[QMK](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmwarehttp:// "QMK") and [Vial](https://github.com/vial-kb/vial-qmk "Vial") firmwares has very barebones key mapping. Good for quick testing.

PCB design uses footprints from [ScottoKeebs](https://github.com/joe-scotto/scottokeebs/tree/main/Extras/ScottoKicad "ScottoKeebs") and [kbd library.](https://github.com/foostan/kbd "kbd library.")



### TODO
1. Clean up code
2. Add RGB support
3. Make default keymap usable
